# Data Structures and Algorithms in C++

Although I've studied data structures and algorithms in the past (2008 for my bachelors :)), I don't remember some of the subtleties and their implementation details. Additionally, the stress of assignments and exams didn't let me explore data structures and algorithms in depth. Thus, this is my attempt to relearn data structures and algorithms in depth without any pressure of assignments and exams. 

I chose C++ as my choice of programming language since it is very close to the metal and gives complete control over memory allocation and deallocation. Additionally, I don't feel like using smart pointers since beginners might not know what happens in the background.  I would like to also add respective python implementations for some of the data structures but I cannot promise this. During this entire process, I've used a terrific book named [Data Abstraction & Problem Solving with C++: Walls and Mirrors](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Abstraction-Problem-Solving-Mirrors/dp/0132923726) as a reference and also have corrected some of the errors in the code snippets presented in the book while attempting to rewrite or reimplement parts of the book.

# IDE Setup
I've used vscode and I've also provided setup instructions in the directory called [0_initial_Setup](./0_initial_Setup). Finally, to compile and run the code enter the respective directory and you could use -std=c++11 or -std=c++14 to compile the code
```
g++ -std=c++14 *.cpp
./a.exe
```
